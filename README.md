# nodejs-fundamentals

This repository contains some exercises and examples from Free Code Camp video "Nodejs and Express.js
- Full Course". I'm really into Nodejs and Express.js and fortunately I've found that YouTube channel 
through my tutor and old firend Julio Betta. I'm going through the fundamentals of nodejs by here and 
if you'd like to check the video, just access the link from here: https://youtu.be/Oe421EPjeBE
I hope you enjoy all this as much as I do.
